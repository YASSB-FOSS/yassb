# `include-styles-src` directive

Like `include-styles-src`, but for styles. Injects a link element the the css file generated by YASSB. It does not require any parameter:

    <!-- include-styles-src -->

YASSB will determine the name of the css bundle previously generated, its absolute url, and will add it where the directive is found.

Please note that inserting the link manually is not advised as the css filename contains the version of the website, as it appears in `package.json`. Manually writing the `href` attribute value will require to update the url to the file every time such version is changed.
